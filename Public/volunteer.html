        <p>I have been volunteerly working SİTODED more than 2 years. There we learn and teach about young 
            people, educational techniques and organizing events from small scale(5-20 people) to bigger 
            scales (up to 400). I have launch my own events about entreprenurship and social side of it, 
            also join and take roles for various other events. There I have improved my communication and 
            team working skills by a huge margin and also fulfill my desire to help other people.
